## <a name="terminology"></a>Terminology

- **Infrastructure Package:** A reusable, tested, documented, configurable, best-practices definition of a single
piece of Infrastructure (e.g., Docker cluster, VPC, Jenkins, Consul), written using a combination of Terraform, Go, and Bash. This code has been proven in production, providing the underlying infrastructure for [Gruntwork's customers](http://www.gruntwork.io/clients).

- **Module:** Each Infrastructure Package consists one or more orthogonal modules that handle some specific aspect of that Infrastructure Package's functionality. Breaking the code up into multiple modules makes it easier to reuse and compose to handle many different use cases.

- **Reference Architecture:** A best-practices way to combine all of Gruntwork's Infrastructure Packages into an end-to-end tech stack that contains just about all the infrastructure a company needs, including Docker clusters, databases, caches, load balancers, VPCs, CI servers, VPN servers, monitoring systems, log aggregation, alerting, secrets management, and so on. We build this all using infrastructure as code and immutable infrastructure principles, give you 100% of the code, and can get it deployed in minutes. Learn more about what is included in the Reference Architecture in our blog post [How to Build an End to End Production-Grade Architecture on AWS](https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-to-build-an-end-to-end-production-grade-architecture-on-aws-part-1-eae8eeb41fec).

## <a name="reference-architecture"></a>Reference Architecture

The Gruntwork Reference Architecture is a best-practices way to combine all of Gruntwork's Infrastructure Packages into an end-to-end tech stack that contains just about all the infrastructure a company needs, including Docker clusters, databases, caches, load balancers, VPCs, CI servers, VPN servers, monitoring systems, log aggregation, alerting, secrets management, and so on. We build this all using infrastructure as code and immutable infrastructure principles, give you 100% of the code, and can get it deployed in minutes. Learn more about what is included in the Reference Architecture in our blog post [How to Build an End to End Production-Grade Architecture on AWS](https://blog.gruntwork.io/how-to-build-an-end-to-end-production-grade-architecture-on-aws-part-1-eae8eeb41fec).

You can view the Reference Architecture for a fictional company, Acme, in one of two flavors:

1. [Single-account reference architecture](#single-account-reference-architecture)
1. [Multi-account reference architecture](#multi-account-reference-architecture)

### Single-account reference architecture

In a single account setup, all environments (e.g., stage, prod, etc) are deployed in a single AWS account, albeit, in separate VPCs. This gives you ease-of-use and convenience, but not as much isolation/security.

1. [infrastructure-modules](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/infrastructure-modules-acme): The reusable modules that define the infrastructure for the entire company.
1. [infrastructure-live](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/infrastructure-live-acme): Use the modules in infrastructure-modules to deploy all of the live environments for the company.
1. [sample-app-frontend](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/sample-app-frontend-acme): A sample app that demonstrates best practices for an individual Docker-based frontend app or microservice that talks to backend apps (showing how to do service discovery) and returns HTML. This app is written in NodeJS but these practices are broadly applicable (and in the case of Docker, reusable!) across any technology platform.
1. [sample-app-backend](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/sample-app-backend-acme): A sample app that demonstrates best practices for an individual Docker-based backend app or microservice that talks to a database. This app is written in NodeJS but these practices are broadly applicable (and in the case of Docker, reusable!) across any technology platform.

### Multi-account reference architecture

In a multi-account setup, each environment (e.g., stage, prod, etc) is deployed into a separate AWS account, and in its own VPC within that account. All IAM users are defined in yet another AWS account called security, and you can assume IAM roles to switch between accounts. This gives you much more fine-grained control over security, and complete isolation between accounts, but there it's less convenient to use, as you have to keep switching between accounts.

1. [infrastratructure-modules](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/infrastructure-modules-multi-account-acme): The reusable modules that define the infrastructure for the entire company.

## <a name="operating-system-compatibility"></a>Operating system compatibility

Here's a summary of the operating systems supported by Gruntwork as of January, 2019:

* **Modules vs dev tools**: Just about all of our _modules_ for running various types of infrastructure—e.g., Kafka, ZooKeeper, ELK, MongoDB, OpenVPN, Jenkins, etc—assume they are being deployed on Linux servers. In practice, this means that all the `install-xxx` and `run-xxx` scripts (e.g., install-kafka, run-kafka) are written in Bash and don't work on Windows. However, our _dev tools_—the tools that we expect developers to run on their own computer to interact with the infrastructure—are often portable and work on most major operating systems.

* **The basic dev tools**: The basic dev tools we use are Terraform, Packer, and Docker, all of which should work on all major operating systems.

* **Terraform modules**: Just about all the modules we write in Terraform work on all major operating systems. However, there are a few places where we were forced to call out to scripts from our Terraform code. Most of these scripts are Python and work on all major operating systems, but there are a couple places where we lazily call Bash code (mostly `sleep 30` to work around Terraform bugs). If you run into a portability issue, please report it as a bug, and we'll get it fixed!

* **Go**: We've written a number of dev tools in Go, which we compile into standalone binaries that should work on every major operating system. This applies to:
    - Terragrunt
    - Terratest
    - OpenVPN: `openvpn-admin`
    - Houston: `houston` CLI
    - Security: `gruntkms`, `ssh-grunt`
    - cloud-nuke
    - API Gateway and SAM: `gruntsam`
    - Kubernetes / EKS: `kubergrunt`

* **Python**: We have some dev tools that we wrote in Python. Most of these work on all major operating systems, but there are occasional gotchas with Windows path length limits, and some Python 2 vs 3 issues. This applies to:
    - AMI cluster: The `asg-rolling-deploy` and `server-group` Terraform modules call out to Python scripts.
    - Docker cluster: `roll-out-ecs-cluster-update.py`

* **Bash**: We have a small number of dev tools that we wrote in Bash. These will work on Linux and Mac, but not on Windows (unless you use Cygwin or the new Windows 10 Bash Shell, but even then, portability isn't guaranteed). This applies to:
    - Gruntwork Installer
    - CI / CD: `aws-helpers`, `build-helpers`, `check-url`, `circleci-helpers`, `git-helpers`, `terraform-helpers`
    - Stateful server: `attach-eni`, `mount-ebs-volume`, `add-dns-a-record`
    - Security: `aws-auth`
    - Docker cluster: `ecs-deploy`

* **Tests**: It's worth noting all of our tests currently run on Linux, which means Windows-specific bugs do slip through periodically.

* **Need Windows support?** The vast majority of our customers use Linux or Mac, so we haven't prioritized improving our Windows support. If you would like us to improve our Windows support, we would be happy to discuss a project to do so as part of our [Custom Module Development](https://gruntwork.io/custom-module-development/) process.


## <a name="how-to-use-the-code"></a>How to use the code

There's a lot of great code here, but how do you use it in your own infracture and apps? There are two options:

1. [Reference it from the Gruntwork repos](#reference-it-from-the-gruntwork-repos) (recommended)
1. [Fork the code to your own repos](#fork-the-code-to-your-own-repos)

Note, you must be a [Gruntwork Subscriber](https://www.gruntwork.io/pricing/) to use either of these options!

### Reference it from the Gruntwork repos

The approach we recommend is to reference the code directly from the Gruntwork repos.

**For Terraform code**, you can use a Gruntwork module by referencing the Git URL in the `source` parameter. For example, to use our [VPC module](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-vpc) in your code:

```hcl
# Create a VPC using the Gruntwork VPC module
module "vpc_app" {
  source = "git::git@github.com:gruntwork-io/module-vpc.git//modules/vpc-app?ref=v0.5.5"

  vpc_name         = "prod"
  aws_region       = "us-east-1"
  cidr_block       = "10.0.0.0/18"
  num_nat_gateways = 3
}
```

A few things to note about the `source` URL above:

1. **Versioned URL** (note the `ref=v0.5.5`): This gives you a known, fixed version of each module, with consistent and reproducible behavior. We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)  for our code and publish release notes for each release so you know how to upgrade and if there were any backward incompatible changes. If you want to upgrade to new infrastructure, just bump the version number and run `terraform apply`!

1. **SSH for authentication**: If you [associate an SSH key with your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) and use [ssh-agent](https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent), you will not be prompted for any passwords. You can use a similar approach with your machine users in CI / CD environments.

**For binaries and scripts**, you can use the [gruntwork-installer](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-installer) with the `--repo` parameter pointing to Gruntwork repos. For example, to install the [ssh-grunt binary](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-security/tree/master/modules/ssh-grunt) (which lets you manage SSH access using an Identity Provider such as IAM, Google, ADFS, etc) on your EC2 Instances:

```bash
gruntwork-install --binary-name 'gruntkms' --repo https://github.com/gruntwork-io/gruntkms --tag 'v0.0.8'
```

A few notes about the `gruntwork-install` call above:

1. **Versioned URL** (note the `--tag 'v0.0.8'`): This gives you a known, fixed version of each script and binary, with consistent and reproducible behavior. If you want to upgrade to a new binary or script, just bump the version number and re-run!
1. **GitHub  authentication**: We use a [GitHub personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) to authenticate. You set your token as the environment variable `GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN`.
1. **Pre-compiled binaries**: The example above installs a pre-compiled binary for your operating system. `gruntkms` is one of the many tools we write in Go and compile as standalone binaries for different operating systems.
1. **Windows users**: `gruntwork-install` is a Bash script, which should work fine on Linux and OS X, but might be tricky to use with Windows. In those cases, you'll want to download the binaries you depend on manually.


### Fork the code to your own repos

Some companies do not allow dependencies on external repos and require that everything is pulled from an internal source (e.g., GitHub Enterprise, BitBucket, etc). In that case, the [Gruntwork License](https://gruntwork.io/terms/) gives you permissions to fork our code into your own repos.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The definition of a "user" does NOT change if you fork the code. That is, if you create internal forks and give 50 users access to those internal forks, then the Gruntwork License requires that you pay for 50 users.

Here's how you fork the code:

1. Copy each Gruntwork repo into your private repositories.
1. You'll also want to copy all the versioned releases (see the `/releases` page for each repo).
1. For repos that contain pre-built binaries (such as `ssh-grunt` mentioned earlier), you'll want to copy those binaries into the releases as well.
1. Within each repo, search for any cross-references to other Gruntwork repos. Most of our repos are standalone, but some of the Terraform and Go code is shared across repos (e.g., our `package-kafka` and `package-zookeeper` repos use `module-asg` under the hood to run an Auto Scaling Group). You'll need to update Terraform `source` URLs and Go `import` statements from `github.com/gruntwork-io` to your private Git repo URLs.
1. You'll want to automate the entire process and run it on a regular schedule (e.g., daily). Our repos are updated continuously, both by the Gruntwork team and contributions from our community fo customers (see [our monthly newsletter](https://blog.gruntwork.io/tagged/gruntwork-newsletter) for details), so you'll want to pull in these updates as quickly as you can.

Once you've done all the above, you can now use the modules, scripts, and binaries in your code using the same techniques as mentioned earlier (Terraform `module` with `source` URL and `gruntwork-install` with the `--repo` param).

While this approach works, it obviously has some downsides:

1. You have to do a lot of work up-front to copy the  repos, releases, and pre-compiled binaries and update internal links.
1. You have to do more work to run this process on a regular basis and deal with merging conflicts.
1. If your team isn't directly using the Gruntwork GitHub repos on a regular basis, then you're less likely to participate in issues and pull requests, and you won't be benefitting as much from the Gruntwork community.

So, whenever possible, use option #1, referencing Gruntwork repos directly. If your team relies on NPM, Docker Hub, Maven Central, or the Terraform Registry, this is no different! However, if your company completely bans all outside sources, then follow the instructions above to fork our code.
